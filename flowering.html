        <h1>FLOWERING PLANTS </h1>
        <h3> Flowering plants are categorised into various groups. Once you have been acquainted with these groups, you can consider planting and cultivating them as per their life cycles.</h3> 
        <h3>There are three main classifications of flowering plants: perennials, biennials and annuals.</h3>
            <h2> • PERENNIALS </h2>
            <h2> • BIENNIALS  </h2>
            <h2> • ANNUALS    </h2> 
    </div>        
    <section class="per">        
            <h1> • PERENNIALS</h1>
            <h3>
                    Perennial flowering plants are the main dishes of a flower garden. They add structure and beauty to a garden, and as they increase in size the garden becomes established and full.Most perennials are very adaptable; they can be divided and replanted, relocated to create a different design, or moved to a location better suited to meet their requirements
